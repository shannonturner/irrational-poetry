Irrational Poetry

Irrational Poetry finds words hidden in irrational numbers (or streams of psuedorandom digits).

By default, Irrational Poetry generates its own stream of psuedorandom digits, but it can be configured to use a specific irrational number you supply.

Use irrational.py at the command line and specify the minimum length of words you want it to find.  It finds words of length 4 and below very quickly; finding words of length 5 and above get slower with each step.

Nine word lists of common words are provided; by changing the words in these word lists, you can change what Irrational Poetry finds.  The word lists are separated into the minimum length of words.

A small sample of words yielded from Irrational Poetry using a minimum length of 5 are:
